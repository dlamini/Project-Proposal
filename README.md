Our mission for our e-commerce site is to present consumers with designs, styling and clothes that energizes any event or everyday living type of fashion. Whether it be student at university, going out  for cocktails, or attending functions, the website will sell comfortable clothing that will look and feel wonderful after purchasing.
An e-commerce site which consists of approximately  seven user pages including the home page, register , products, transaction, about us, etc. the website will be mainly selling specifically female clothes .
Users will be able to view some of the products on our home page just to get an idea as to what the website is all about. If the user wants to navigate further on the site she/he will be required to login to the site and purchase or just navigate through the site. The user will also have the logout option where he/she can leave the site whenever they are finished on the site.
The site will also consist of administration pages where only the administrator can access those pages. The administrator will also be required to login to the site before he can access the admin section. He/she will be able to update, view, and fix the errors that occur in the contents of the database.
On both the user and admin section, necessary validations to whatsoever mistakes will apply to ensure the correct site functionality. By doing this, it will guide both the user and the administrator on how to avoid the mistakes in the website.
